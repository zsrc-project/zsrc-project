# Zero Source Project
The Zero Source Project (zsrc.org) is an open-source, community-driven initiative that bridges critical documentation gaps for the Information Technology (IT) and Cybersecurity fields. We empower professionals to collaboratively build a dynamic, crowdsourced knowledge network of detailed, field-tested guides. These practical, open-source resources complement official technical sources with real-world implementation steps, security best practices, and proven troubleshooting solutions.

## Our Mission
The Zero Source Project platform facilitates active discussions, shared tools, and collective problem-solving. By harnessing the expertise of the open community, we aim to become the go-to hub for crowd-sourced, practitioner-led content that empowers IT and security teams to overcome challenges not addressed by standard references.
Our mission is to transform the way technical communities discover, apply, and expand institutional knowledge - moving from passive consumption to active co-creation of the resources they need most. The Zero Source Project is built on the principles of open collaboration and shared innovation to advance the state of the art in IT and security documentation.
